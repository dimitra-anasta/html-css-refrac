# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refractor

## For this challenge, I refactored existing code in order for it to meet a certain standard, specifically making it more accessible. I also improved the CSS by consolidating selectors and properties. And finally, I fixed any links on the webpage that were not functioning.


## Installation
The first thing I did in this challenge was give the site a concise title "Horiseon" by editing line 7 and inserting the name between the title tags.


Next, in CSS, I grouped the .benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, and .benefit-cost properties together because they all shared the same property but were coded individually. I reapeted this process for the following selectors to help clean the CSS page:

1. .benefit-lead h3, .benefit-brand h3, .benefit-cost h3 
2. .benefit-lead img, .benefit-brand img, .benefit-cost img
3. #search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media-marketing 
4. #search-engine-optimization img, .online-reputation-management img, .social-media-marketing img,  
5. #search-engine-optimization h2, .online-reputation-management h2, .social-media-marketing h2. 


Next, I edited the images on the html. First, I added the accessible alt attributes to make the page more accessible and provided a brief decription of each image. 

I added "./develop" to reference my css style sheet on line 6, and also added "./Develop" the img src tags to locate the images correctly on the website. 


I fixed the "Search Engine Optimization" button on the site, so that when it is clicked, it sends the user to that part of the site. I did this by fixing line 29, because it was missing the "id" tag.
